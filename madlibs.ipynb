      "In the light of the moon, a little egg lay on a leaf. One Tuesday morning the warm sun came up and - POP - out of the egg came a tiny, very hungry rat. She started looking for some food. On Wednesday she ate through one grapes. But she was still hungry. On Thursday she ate through two blackberries. But she was still hungry. On Friday she ate through three raspberries. But she was still hungry. On Saturday she ate through four peachs. But she was still hungry. On Sunday she ate through five lemons. But she was still hungry. On Monday she ate through one piece of strawberry cake, one scoop of salty ice cream, one slice of sea bass, one piece of cranberry pie and lots of mozzarella. That night she had a tummy ache! The next day was Tuesday again. The rat wasn't hungry anymore. And she wasn't tiny anymore. She was a big fat rat. She built a cosy house around herself and stayed inside for more than 6 weeks. Then she nibbled a hole in the house, pushed her way out and she was now a beautiful giraffe.\n"
